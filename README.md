# interviewScheduler
Using django as backend, created this interview Scheduler. (ISTE Manipal club - internal purpose)
---
So there are basically two types of user: 
- admin (who can create different panels and its slots for interview purpose)
- student (who can book a interview time slot if available)
---
After the student confirms the details and books a time slot,
the student will get an confirmed date email.
